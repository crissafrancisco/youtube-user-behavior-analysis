# Personal YouTube Streaming & Search History Analysis

## About This Project

This project is a personal exploration of my own **YouTube watch and search history**, downloaded via [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).  
The notebook analyzes how my viewing habits have changed over time — from binge-watching dramas to searching for Python tutorials.  

It reflects how digital behavior can mirror real-life milestones, evolving interests, and even weekend routines.

## Goals

- Clean and organize raw YouTube watch and search data
- Discover trends in **what**, **when**, and **why** I watch
- Connect **search intent** to actual **watch behavior**
- Explore shifts in content preference from entertainment to education
- Build a personal data story using Python

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data: Google Takeout exports (`watch-history.json`, `search-history.json`)

---

## Key Analyses

- Watch & Search Trends by Year and Time of Day
- Most Watched Channels (dramas, travel vlogs, comedy, etc.)
- Rewatch Behavior (notably high in 2020)
- Viewing Routines (e.g., peak on Sunday afternoons)
- Top Search Terms by Year
- Search-to-Watch Match Rate (how often searches led to viewing)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Content Evolution**  
   - 2020–2022: heavy on dramas, movies, comfort content  
   - 2023–2024: shift toward travel, lifestyle, food  
   - 2025: spike in tech/programming content — aligned with starting my master’s  

2. **Cooking is a Constant**  
   - “recipe” and “cook” appear consistently in both watch and search history  

3. **Search & Watch Connection**  
   - Many search queries (tutorials, dramas, careers) directly led to watching related content  

4. **Behavioral Routines**  
   - Evenings and **Sunday afternoons (2–4 PM)** are consistent peak viewing times  

5. **2020 Pandemic Rewatching**  
   - Significantly more rewatching, likely due to boredom and using YouTube like a music player

## Sample Visuals

- Yearly watch and search volume  
- Most watched channels and rewatched content  
- Time-of-day viewing patterns  
- Shorts vs. regular video trends  
- Search-to-watch connections

## What I Learned

- YouTube activity can reflect personal phases and interests
- Even basic metadata (titles and timestamps) reveals clear patterns
- This was both a technical and a reflective exercise

---

## Next Steps

- Add interactive visualizations (Plotly, Streamlit)
- Compare with other personal datasets (Spotify, Google Location History)
- Package as a portfolio storytelling project
